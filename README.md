Plan structured training programs, log complex workouts with voice or free-text using Gemini LLMs to parse sets & reps, automatically sync activities from Strava and Garmin Connect, and get real-time prescriptive AI coaching to adjust your volume based on your completed results.

## Features

### Unified Training Experience
- **Interactive Timeline** — Drag-and-drop view spanning past, present, and future workouts with status indicators (completed, planned, missed).
- **Timeline Annotations** — Mark date ranges as injury / illness / travel / rest so dips in volume are visible in context on the Timeline and as shaded bands on Analytics charts.
- **Training Plans** — Import CSV, DOCX, or PDF training blocks, use the built-in 8-week Hyrox program, or generate a fully custom plan via AI.
- **Custom Exercises** — Log non-standard movements (sled pushes, sandbag lunges) alongside standard lifts.
- **Guided Onboarding** — Configure profile, units, and weekly goals on first launch.

### Gemini AI Engine
- **Workout Parsing** — Say or type *"3 sets bench 225lbs x 8, then 3 miles in 24 min"* and Gemini parses it into structured data with Zod-validated schemas.
- **Photo-to-Workout** — Snap a photo of a workout plan (whiteboard, gym printout, coach's notes) and Gemini extracts the exercises, sets, and prescribed loads. Images are compressed client-side before upload.
- **Auto-Coach** — Reads your plan and recent activity to evaluate fatigue, volume, and pacing, then suggests schedule adjustments with rationale stored alongside each plan day.
- **Streaming Chat** — Ask contextual questions over Server-Sent Events (SSE), e.g. *"What pace for my next 1km run?"*

### RAG-Powered Coaching
- **Document Uploads** — Upload coaching materials (CSV, DOCX, PDF) to enrich the AI coach's knowledge base.
- **Vector Search** — Documents are chunked and embedded via pgvector for semantic retrieval-augmented generation.

### Activity Sync
- **Strava** — OAuth link with HMAC-signed state; activities auto-appear on the timeline with encrypted token storage and per-user dedupe.
- **Garmin Connect** — Email/password link against the reverse-engineered Garmin SSO, protected by a global 429 circuit breaker, a per-user in-flight mutex, and a 5-minute minimum sync interval. Credentials and OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest. *(Note: Garmin 2-step verification must be disabled for the current SSO library to authenticate.)*

### Analytics & Export
- **Personal Records** — 1RM estimation, lifetime PRs, and progression charts.
- **Week-over-Week Deltas** — The Analytics overview shows percentage-change indicators against the equal-length prior period for total workouts, avg/week, total duration, and avg duration.
- **Filtering** — Drill down by exercise category, date range, or micro-cycle.
- **Data Export** — Download workout timeline and exercise sets as CSV or JSON.
- **Email Notifications** — Opt-in weekly training summaries and missed-day reminders via pg-boss + Resend, with a master toggle plus independent per-type switches (`emailWeeklySummary`, `emailMissedReminder`).

### Privacy & Data Control
- **GDPR Account Deletion** — `DELETE /api/v1/account` removes your Clerk identity, best-effort deauthorizes Strava, and cascade-deletes every row owned by the user across `workout_logs`, `exercise_sets`, `training_plans`, `plan_days`, `chat_messages`, `coaching_materials`, `document_chunks`, `strava_connections`, `garmin_connections`, `custom_exercises`, `push_subscriptions`, `ai_usage_logs`, `idempotency_keys`, and `timeline_annotations`.
- **AI Consent Gate** — The AI coach is opt-in (`aiCoachEnabled`, defaults `false`); no workout data is sent to Google Gemini until the user explicitly enables it.
- **Privacy Policy** — First-party Privacy page (`client/src/pages/Privacy.tsx`) listing every third-party processor (Clerk, Gemini, Strava, Garmin, Resend, Sentry) and the data they receive.

### PWA & Offline
- **Installable** — Progressive Web App with Workbox service worker for offline caching and native-like mobile experience.

## 🏗 Architecture & Tech Stack

This repository is a fully functional monorepo containing both the React frontend and the Express REST API backend, written entirely in strictly typed **TypeScript**.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18, Vite 5, TypeScript 5.9
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 layered over shadcn/ui (accessible Radix primitives)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for optimized server state caching
- **Client Routing**: wouter for ultra-lightweight navigation
- **Drag & Drop**: dnd-kit for sortable, accessible drag-and-drop interactions
- **Visualization**: Recharts for interactive performance charts
- **PWA**: vite-plugin-pwa + Workbox for offline support and installability
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for real-time error monitoring

### Backend
- **API Runtime**: Node.js + Express 4 with thin controller wrappers and thick service abstractions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/)) bridged by the type-safe Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Clerk JWT middleware protecting all private endpoints
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for workout parsing and coaching
- **Vector DB**: pgvector on [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for RAG document embeddings
- **Job Queue**: pg-boss for background tasks (email scheduling, maintenance)
- **Email**: Resend for transactional email delivery
- **Logging**: Pino + pino-http for structured, high-performance logging
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI auto-generated from Zod schemas via zod-to-openapi
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime schema validation with drizzle-zod integration
- **Security**:
  - Helmet for HTTP security headers
  - express-rate-limit for granular API rate limiting
  - csrf-csrf for CSRF protection (double-submit cookie pattern bound to Clerk userId); in production `CSRF_SECRET` is required and **must differ** from `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (key separation is enforced at startup)
  - Server-side idempotency enforcement via `X-Idempotency-Key` header with database-backed cache; pg-boss job retries are scoped to idempotent handlers only (`sendJobNoRetry` for side-effectful handlers like email send)
  - Compression middleware skips `text/event-stream` responses to unblock Gemini streaming chat
  - AES-256-GCM encryption for Strava and Garmin credentials / tokens at rest
  - Strava OAuth CSRF state verification
  - Garmin 7-layer safety stack: per-route rate limiter, per-user mutex, 5-minute min-sync interval, fail-fast on prior `lastError`, global 30-minute 429 circuit breaker, no silent re-login on stale tokens, audit logging on every Garmin call
  - HTML sanitization of AI-generated content

### Shared
- Shared Zod schemas and TypeScript types between client and server
- OpenAPI spec generation from Zod schemas

## 📖 API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available via **Swagger UI** at `/api/docs` when the server is running. The spec is auto-generated from Zod schemas using `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi`, ensuring documentation always stays in sync with the codebase.

A committed OpenAPI 3.0 snapshot is also kept at [`docs/openapi.json`](docs/openapi.json). Regenerate it with `pnpm docs:openapi`; the `Build` CI job fails if the committed file drifts from the Zod schemas, making API changes diff-visible in every pull request.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the full application ecosystem locally.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v9.x — run `corepack enable` to auto-install)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension — production uses [Railway](https://railway.app/) for the main DB and [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for vector embeddings
- A [Clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev/) account for auth (optional — use `ALLOW_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` for local dev)
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) key for AI features (optional)

### 1. Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

At minimum, set the two **required** variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` – PostgreSQL connection string
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` – 32+ char hex key (generate with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the copy-template and [`docs/env-reference.md`](docs/env-reference.md) for the curated reference with per-variable context and safety invariants (Clerk auth, Gemini AI, Strava sync, Resend email, Web Push, Sentry, and more).

### 2. Installation & Database Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate and run Drizzle ORM migrations
pnpm run db:generate
pnpm run db:migrate
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This fires up the Vite frontend with HMR and the Express backend on port `5000`. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
